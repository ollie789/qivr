# Clinic Dashboard API Alignment â€“ Progress Snapshot

_Last updated: 2025-09-29_

## Completed
- Confirmed existing dashboard endpoints (`/overview`, `/schedule/weekly`, `/metrics`) and removed legacy references (`/stats`, `/recent-activities`, `/appointments/today`, `/appointments/upcoming`).
- Hardened `GET /api/clinic-dashboard/metrics` against empty datasets (safe averaging, percentage calculations) to prevent 500s when no appointments exist.
- Updated `test-all-endpoints.sh` to exercise the real dashboard routes and print cleaner failure output.

## Next
- Review dashboard data seeds so overview/metrics return meaningful sample payloads for automated tests.
- Continue pruning unused scripts/docs as we move into the patient dashboard feature set.
- Expand automated tests (unit/integration) around the metrics helpers once data scaffolding is available.

## Notes
- Metrics now reuse a single appointment count to avoid redundant queries and divide-by-zero errors.
- The harness still expects a tenant header; ensure multi-tenant selector stays in sync when deriving tokens for tests.
