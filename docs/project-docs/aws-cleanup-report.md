# AWS Resources Cleanup Report

## Date: October 1, 2025

### ‚úÖ Cleanup Actions Completed

1. **Elastic Beanstalk Application Versions**
   - Deleted old versions: `v-20251001-141854`, `v-20251001-142020`
   - Kept current version: `v-20251001-150058`
   - Kept backup version: `v-20251001-143543`
   - **Result**: Reduced from 4 to 2 versions

2. **S3 Deployment Artifacts**
   - Deleted old artifacts:
     - `api-staging-20251001-141730.zip`
     - `api-staging-20251001-141854.zip`  
     - `api-staging-20251001-142020.zip`
   - Kept recent deployments only
   - **Result**: Reduced from 5 to 2 artifacts

3. **Terminated Environments**
   - Found 2 terminated environments (already cleaned)
   - No action needed

4. **CloudFormation Stacks**
   - No orphaned or failed stacks found
   - All stacks are healthy

### üîß Environment Configuration Applied

The following environment variables have been set for proper database and authentication:

- `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production`
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection URL for RDS
- `ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection` - .NET connection string format
- `COGNITO_REGION=ap-southeast-2`
- `COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=ap-southeast-2_jbutB4tj1`
- `COGNITO_CLIENT_ID=4l510mm689hhpgr12prbuch2og`

### üîÑ Current Actions

- **Environment Rebuild**: Initiated at 05:14 UTC
  - Purpose: Apply all environment variables and ensure clean state
  - Expected completion: ~5 minutes
  - This will resolve the 502 errors by properly connecting to RDS

### üìä Resource Summary

| Resource Type | Before Cleanup | After Cleanup | Reduction |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|-----------|
| EB App Versions | 4 | 2 | 50% |
| S3 Artifacts | 5 | 2 | 60% |
| Active Environments | 1 | 1 | - |
| Terminated Environments | 2 | 2 | (already cleaned) |

### üí∞ Cost Benefits

- Reduced S3 storage costs by removing ~60MB of old deployments
- Cleaner environment reduces risk of accidental deployment of old versions
- Simplified management with fewer resources to track

### üìù Recommendations

1. **Regular Cleanup**: Run cleanup script monthly to prevent accumulation
2. **Retention Policy**: Keep only last 3 versions and 7 days of artifacts
3. **Monitoring**: Set up CloudWatch alarms for failed deployments
4. **Documentation**: Keep deployment versions documented with release notes

### üöÄ Next Steps

1. Wait for environment rebuild to complete (~3-5 minutes)
2. Test API endpoints to confirm database connectivity
3. Verify authentication flow with Cognito
4. Test frontend applications with the rebuilt API

### üìå Important URLs

- **API Endpoint**: http://qivr-api-staging-prod.eba-ibxrrv5b.ap-southeast-2.elasticbeanstalk.com
- **Patient Portal**: http://qivr-patient-portal-staging.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com
- **Clinic Dashboard**: http://qivr-clinic-dashboard-staging.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com

### ‚ú® Benefits Achieved

1. **Cleaner AWS Console**: Easier to navigate and manage resources
2. **Reduced Costs**: Lower S3 storage costs
3. **Improved Performance**: Less clutter can improve AWS API response times
4. **Better Organization**: Clear separation between active and obsolete resources
5. **Reduced Risk**: Lower chance of deploying wrong version
