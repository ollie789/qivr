## üîß Immediate Action Items (Today)

Based on the spec and current state, here's what to do RIGHT NOW:

### 1. Complete Appointments Page (2-3 hours)
The Appointments page is just a placeholder. Let's build it properly with:
- Calendar view (day/week/month)
- Appointment list
- Create/edit appointment dialogs
- Provider filtering

### 2. Connect Widget to Backend (1-2 hours)
The widget form submits but doesn't save:
- Update endpoint to match backend API
- Add proper error handling
- Show success confirmation
- Test complete flow

### 3. Fix Patient Portal Dashboard (1-2 hours)
The patient portal dashboard is empty:
- Add appointment cards
- Show recent evaluations
- PROM reminders
- Quick actions

### 4. Implement Real Data Flow (1 hour)
Replace remaining mock data:
- Update all API calls to use real endpoints
- Remove TestDataController dependency
- Ensure auth tokens are passed

## üìã Technical Debt to Address

1. **Code Organization**
   - Some components are too large (Widget.tsx is 400+ lines)
   - Need to extract reusable components
   - API service layer needs consolidation

2. **Type Safety**
   - Missing TypeScript interfaces for API responses
   - Any types in several places
   - Need OpenAPI code generation

3. **Error Handling**
   - Inconsistent error handling
   - Need global error boundary
   - Better loading states

4. **Testing**
   - No tests written yet
   - Need unit tests for services
   - Integration tests for API

## üèÅ Definition of MVP (from Spec)

According to SPEC-001, the MVP must have:

1. ‚úÖ Widget with 3D body map, intake, social/email sign-in
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Patient Portal: reviewed AI summary, appointments view/rebook, PROM timeline
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Clinic Dashboard: evaluation review, calendar link, PROM designer, outcomes dashboard
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Booking: Google & Microsoft calendars; webhooks/deltas; double-booking guard
5. ‚ùå SMS reminders + links; optional voice callback
6. ‚úÖ Multi-tenant RLS Postgres; S3 data lake export; theming & localization v1

**MVP Completion: ~60%**

## üö¶ Go/No-Go Criteria for Pilot

Before onboarding pilot clinics (M7), we need:

- [ ] Complete user flows working end-to-end
- [ ] Calendar integration tested with real accounts
- [ ] PROM system functional with scheduling
- [ ] SMS notifications working
- [ ] Basic analytics dashboard
- [ ] Security audit passed
- [ ] Performance testing completed
- [ ] Backup/restore tested
- [ ] Documentation complete

## üìû Support Needed

Based on the assessment, consider getting help with:

1. **AWS Infrastructure** - Complex setup requiring expertise
2. **AI Integration** - Bedrock setup and prompt engineering
3. **Security Audit** - Professional penetration testing
4. **FHIR Compliance** - Healthcare data standards
