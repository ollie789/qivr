## üîß Immediate Action Items (Priority Order)

Based on the current state and spec requirements:

### 1. Wire Up Widget to Backend (2-3 hours) - CRITICAL
The widget exists but doesn't save data:
- Connect to /api/evaluations endpoint
- Save 3D body mapping pain points
- Ensure data appears in IntakeQueue
- Add success/error feedback
- Test complete submission flow

### 2. Complete Appointments Page (3-4 hours) - HIGH
Enhance the basic appointments structure:
- Implement calendar views (day/week/month)
- Connect to real appointment data
- Integrate ScheduleAppointmentDialog
- Add provider filtering
- Enable appointment CRUD operations

### 3. Enhance Patient Portal (2-3 hours) - HIGH
Make the patient portal functional:
- Build real dashboard with appointments/PROMs
- Connect appointment booking
- Wire up PROM submission
- Display evaluation history
- Add profile management

### 4. Fix Integration Issues (1-2 hours) - MEDIUM
Address remaining integration problems:
- Verify all API authentication
- Fix any CORS issues
- Ensure data flows correctly between components
- Remove mock data dependencies

## üìã Technical Debt to Address

1. **Code Organization**
   - Some components are too large (Widget.tsx is 400+ lines)
   - Need to extract reusable components
   - API service layer needs consolidation

2. **Type Safety**
   - Missing TypeScript interfaces for API responses
   - Any types in several places
   - Need OpenAPI code generation

3. **Error Handling**
   - Inconsistent error handling
   - Need global error boundary
   - Better loading states

4. **Testing**
   - No tests written yet
   - Need unit tests for services
   - Integration tests for API

## üèÅ Definition of MVP (from Spec)

According to SPEC-001, the MVP must have:

1. ‚úÖ Widget with 3D body map, intake, social/email sign-in
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Patient Portal: reviewed AI summary, appointments view/rebook, PROM timeline
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Clinic Dashboard: evaluation review, calendar link, PROM designer, outcomes dashboard
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Booking: Google & Microsoft calendars; webhooks/deltas; double-booking guard
5. ‚ùå SMS reminders + links; optional voice callback
6. ‚úÖ Multi-tenant RLS Postgres; S3 data lake export; theming & localization v1

**MVP Completion: ~70%**

## üö¶ Go/No-Go Criteria for Pilot

Before onboarding pilot clinics (M7), we need:

- [ ] Complete user flows working end-to-end
- [ ] Calendar integration tested with real accounts
- [ ] PROM system functional with scheduling
- [ ] SMS notifications working
- [ ] Basic analytics dashboard
- [ ] Security audit passed
- [ ] Performance testing completed
- [ ] Backup/restore tested
- [ ] Documentation complete

## üìû Support Needed

Based on the assessment, consider getting help with:

1. **AWS Infrastructure** - Complex setup requiring expertise
2. **AI Integration** - Bedrock setup and prompt engineering
3. **Security Audit** - Professional penetration testing
4. **FHIR Compliance** - Healthcare data standards
